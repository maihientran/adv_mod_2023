Project: The sleeping barber problem
If there is no client, the barber goes to sleep at the barber's chair.
When a client arrives, if the barber is sleeping, the customer wakes him up and is served at the barber's chair.
If the barber is not sleeping, the customer waits on the chair in the waiting room.
If no chair is available, customer leaves.

Model the problem with an automaton.
