Project: The sleeping barber problem - Implemented with IMITATOR
========================================================
* If there is no client, the barber goes to sleep at the barber's chair.
* When a client arrives, if the barber is sleeping, the customer wakes him up and is served at the barber's chair.
* If the barber is not sleeping, the customer waits on the chair in the waiting room.
* If no chair is available, customer leaves.

Model the problem with an automaton.
